Remember we are using the following Libraries: 
- Asio Stand Alone for Networking.
- nlohmann/json for JSON Parsing.
- Catch2 for Testing.

Remember that all the header files has the extension `.hpp`

Remember that we are using the macro `#pragma once` to prevent multiple inclusions of the same header file.

Take into account that this project is written in C++ and the code is located at `src/*` and the header definitions are located at `include/zuno/*`. The code should follow the coding standards of the language and be well documented.

Always use best practices in your code responses, and ensure that the code is self-contained and clear.
