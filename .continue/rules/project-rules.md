We are using the following Libraries: 
- Asio Stand Alone for Networking.
- nlohmann/json for JSON Parsing.
- Catch2 for Testing.

All the header files has the extension `.hpp`

We are using the macro `#pragma once` to prevent multiple inclusions of the same header file.

This project is written in C++ and the code is located at `src/*` and the header definitions are located at `include/zuno/*`. The code should follow the coding standards of the language and be well documented.

Always use best practices in your code responses, and ensure that the code is well-structured and easy to understand.
